EXT. FOOTHILLS OF WHITE MOUNTAINS ,DAY.

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND
sailing through his hair.

                      GANDALF.
           We have just passed into the realm of
           Condor!

EXT. MINAS TIRITH ,DAWN.

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . .

ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin,
its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out,
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

                     GANDALF.
          Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.

Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends
forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the
CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within     the topmost
walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the     BATTLEMENTS
in the morning breeze.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS ,DAY.

GANDALF steering SHADOWFAX up the STEEP STREETS of MINAS
TIRITH.

ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and
PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS . . .

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS ,each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises ,the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK ,shaped like a sharp
ship's prow ,bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS ,DAY.

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY ,1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . .

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye
caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

                         PIPPIN                             ;.

                  (whisper)
             It's the tree.           ,
                  (hurrying after GANDALF)
             Gandalf! Gandalf!

                       GANDALF.
             Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
             the King.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS . . . towards a GREAT HALL benejath
the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         '

                       GANDALF .
             Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
             is a steward only. A caretaker of the
             throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

                        GA ND ALF (c on t'd )
                  (quietly)
             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.
                  (hesitates)
             In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
             all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL ,DAY.

ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR ,the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

                        GANDALF.
             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
             Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                        GANDALF .
             I come with tidings in this dark hour ,and
             with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . .

                         DENETHOR.
                  (bitter)
             Perhaps you come to explain this?

DENETHOR holds up BOROMIR'S BROKEN HORN ...

                          DEN ETH OR (c ont 'd )
             Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is
             dead?

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN remembering . . .

INSERT IMAGE: BOROMIR, as URUK,HAI arrows thud into his body,
he falls to his KNEES . . .

PIPPIN starts forward unable to say nothing . . .

                       .. PIPPIN.
             Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and
             me . . . he fell, defending us from many
             foes.

CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes.

                        GANDALF.
                  (hurried whisper)
             Pippin!

PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD . . .

                        PIPPIN.
             I offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.

                         GANDALF.
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Get up!
                  (a ddre ssin g D ENET HOR)
             My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
             ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
             Steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

DENETHOR gaze turns slowly on GANDALF . . .

                       GANDALF .
            You still have friends ,you are not alone
            in this fight. Send word to Theoden of
            Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                        DENETHOR.
                 (softly)
            You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against Mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW.

                      DENETHOR .
                (contemptuous)
           I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
           yes. Word has reached my ears of this
           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North ,last of a ragged house, long bereft
           of Lordship.

                       GANDALF.
                (stung)
           Authority is not given to you to deny the
           return of the King ,Steward!

                       DENETHOR.
                 (explosive)
            The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

                      GANDALF.
            Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

INT. MINAS TIRITH, PIPPIN'S QUARTERS ,NIGHT.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                     PIPPIN.
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
          position . . . I mean, they don't actually
          expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?

WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks
the GREAT CITY.

                      GANDALF.
          You're in the service of the Steward now ,
          you're going to have to do as you're told,
          Peregrin Took . . .

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN as he stares up at the vast NIGHT SKY.

                     PIPPIN.
          It's so quiet.

GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.

                     GANDALF.
          It's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      PIPPIN.
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape
          is even worse.                                L

GANDALF joins PIPPIN as they look towards the distant, jagged
MOUNTAINS of MORDOR . . .

                        GANDALF.
             There never was much hope.

PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small
self,deprecating smile . . .

                       GANDALF .
             Just a fool's hope.

GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out

ANGLE ON: GANDALF . . . he is almost talking to himself now ..
like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.

                       GANDALF.
             This will be the end of Gondor as we know
             it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
             hardest.

             If the river is taken, if the garrison at
             Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
             city will be gone.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN ... desperately seeking reassurance.

                       PIPPIN.
            But we have the White Wizard. That's got to
            count for something.

GANDALF looks down at PIPPIN, he says nothing ...

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,

             ... disloyalty with vengeance.

DENETHOR addresses his meal . . .

                        DENETHOR .
                  (reasonable)
             I do not think we should so lightly abandon
             the outer defences; defences that your
             brother long held intact.

                        FARAMIR.
             What would you have me do?

                       DENETHOR.
             I will not yield the River and Pelennor
             unfought ,Osgiliath must be retaken.

                        FARAMIR.
             My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

                        DENETHOR.
             Much must be risked in war. Is there a
             Captain here who still has the courage to
             do his Lord's will?

CLOSE ON: FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth.

                        FARAMIR.
                  (quietly)
             You wish now that our places had been
             exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had
             lived?

CLOSE ON: For a brief second, DENETHOR seems to hesitate,
then ...

                        DENETHOR.
                 (coldly)
            Yes, I wish that.

                       FARAMIR.
            Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
            what I can in his stead.

ANGLE ON: FARAMIR bows low to DENETHOR, then turns to leave,
stops, turns back ...

                       FARAMIR .
            If I should return ... think better of me,.
            father.

                       DENETHOR.
            That will depend on the manner of your
            return.

DENETHOR continues with his meal. FARAMIR exits.

                                                             CUT TO:.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE ,DAWN.

AERIAL SHOT: . . . HIGH above MINAS MORGUL, on the SMALL LEDGE
next to the STAIRS, LIE the FIGURES of FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM.

SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD
. .. Quietly he SPRINKLES CRUMBS over the sleeping SAM.

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD over
the cliff.

CLOSE ON: SAM'S EYES flick open . . . GOLLUM spins around,
caught off guard . . .

                        SAM.
             What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?

                        SMEAGOL.
                  (prevaricating)
             Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
             polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "Sneak!" "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
             yes, my Precious, very nice.

                        SAM.
             Alright, alright ,you just startled me is
             all.
                  (peering over the cliff's edge)
             What were you doing?

                          SMEAGOL.
                  (sly)
             Sneaking!

Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

                        SAM.
             Fine, have it your own way.

SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.                            ,

                        SAM .
             Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
             moving on.

SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat.
FRODO sits up slowly.

                        FRODO                              .
             It's dark still.

                        SAM.
             It's always dark here ,

CLOSE ON: SAM stops rummaging . . . SHOCK on his face.

                        SAM .
             It's gone . . . the Elven bread!

                       FRODO.
                (alarmed)
           What? That's all we have left!

SAM slowly turns to GOLLUM ...

                      SAM.
                (dawning realisation)
           He took it! He must have!

                      GOLLUM.
                (shocked)
           Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol
           hates nasty Elf bread!

                     SAM.
           You're a lying wretch! What did you do with
           it?

                      FRODO.
           He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken
           it.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM slaps his hand against SAM'S JACKET . . .
sending LEMBAS CRUMBS RAINING DOWN!

                      GOLLUM.
           What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!
                (fake outrage)
           He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's
           always stuffing himself when Master's not
           looking!

                       SAM.
                (angry)
           That's a filthy lie!

SAM is ENRAGED . . . he throws himself at GOLLUM .. punching
him!

                       SAM .
                 (yelling)
           You stinking two,faced sneak! Call me a
           thie . . .
               f

                        FRODO.
                 (yelling)
            Sam! Stop it!

FRODO pulls SAM off GOLLUM ...

                        SAM.
                 (yelling)
            I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

                        FRODO.
            No, Sam!

FRODO COLLAPSES on the GROUND!

CLOSE ON: SAM'S horrified face!

                       SAM.
            Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to
            go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's
            rest up a bit.

SAM attempts to fuss around FRODO ...

                       FRODO.
                  (exhausted)
            I ' m alright.

                      SAM.
           No, no, you're not alright! You're
           exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this
           place; it's that thing around your neck. I
           could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a
           while ,share the load.

CLOSE ON: A terrible light comes into FRODO'S eyes as he
STARES into the EARNEST eyes of SAM.

                       FRODO.
           Get away!

FRODO pushes SAM away, clutching at the RING beneath his shirt

                       SAM.
                 (confused)
            I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to
            help!

FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening
intense ENERGY.

                       GOLLUM.
            See! See! He wants it for himself.

                       SAM.
                 (beside himself)
            Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.

CLOSE ON: FRODO ...

                         FRODO.
                  (quietly)
            No, Sam . . . it's you.

SAM stares at FRODO with DISBELIEF.

                       FRODO .
            I'm sorry, Sam ...

CLOSE ON: TEARS WELL in SAM'S eyes . . .

                       SAM.
                 (hopelessly)
            But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you
            against me.

                       FRODO.
            You can't help me anymore.

                       SAM.
            You don't mean that.

                       FRODO.
                 (eerie calm)
            Go home.

CLOSE ON: TEARS spill down SAM'S cheeks . . . as FRODO TURNS AWAY!

ANGLE ON: FRODO and GOLLUM leave . . . SAM is in complete
MISERY.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF hurries alongside FARAMIR'S HORSE.

                    GANDALF.
          Faramir! Your father's will has turned to
          madness! Do not throw away your life so
          rashly!

                     FARAMIR.
               (deadened)
          Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

GANDALF reads the PAIN in FARAMIR'S eyes . . . he calls after
him, trying one more time to stop the YOUNG MAN.

                     GANDALF.
          Your father loves you, Faramir!

           Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

                      PIPPIN.
                (uneasy)
           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
           own people ... but we have no songs for
           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

                      DENETHOR.
           And why should your songs be unfit for my
           halls, or for hours such as these. Come ,
           sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

                      PIPPIN V/.
           Home is behind, the world ahead,
           And there are many paths to tread.
           Through shadow to the edge of night
